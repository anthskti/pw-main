## _Coding with Video FX background_

Before I start, I used to edit videos, using clips from anime, kdramas, and footage I took.
Check it out here:

## Video Editing → Developer
In video editing, I see a lot of parallels to what I do with software development: design, implement (create transitions), and deploy.

Obviously, designing was the hardest part; finding footage that fits a song and writing a valid story to tell. The biggest difference is that in video editing, you can hide all your flawed effects implementation, but in coding, you can’t.

This is what drew me into developing. Although I still cherish my experience with editing, I think I can do just as well in developing.

All the edits I’ve seen had so much work put into them, and I can’t help but see that grit in people who develop too.

BTW, if you're interested to know my favourite edit I've made:

The vampire bite and the red wine going along with the song is pretty clever lol.

I put a lot of effort into the story telling process while creating cool effects that would transition on scene to another, I find it VERY visually appleasing😄

## Side Note: what I’m thinking of doing.

Sometimes I question: why didn’t I just find a job as a video editor? I do not think AI can replicate anything close to the effects, storytelling, and transitions I’ve designed.
But I’m on my next chapter, and honestly, I still think it’s an amazing hobby to have.

I see myself as a very creative person, so maybe in the future, I’ll start involving video editing in my coding projects, and eventually revolutionize UI.

I also have strong areas in my backend development, knowing how to secure RESTful API calls, dockerize, ship, and more.

In a team, I’d probably be a great fit haha (offer me a job).
