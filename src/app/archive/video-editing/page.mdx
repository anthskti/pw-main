Before I start, I used to edit videos, using clips from anime, kdramas, and footage I took.

## Video Editing → Developer
In video editing, I think there is a lot of parallels to what I do with developing: design, implement (make transitions), and deploy. 

Obviously designing was the hardest part; finding footage that fit a song and finding a valid story to tell. The biggest difference is, video editing, you can hide all your messed up effects, in coding you can't.

This is what drew me into developing. Although I think I still cherish my experience with editing, I think I can do just as well in developing.

All the edits I've seen, edit edit had so much work put into them, and I can't help but see that grit in people who develop too.


### Side Note, what I'm thinking of doing.
Sometimes I question, why didn't I just find a job as a video editor. I do not think AI can go as close as the effects, story telling, and transitions I've done.
But I'm on my next chapter, and honestly, I still think it's an amazing hobby to have.

I see myself as a very creative person, so maybe involving video editing into my coding projects, I can revolutionalize UI.

I also have strong points in my backend development, knowing how to secure RESTful API calls, and such. 

In a team, I'd probably be a great fit haha (offer me a job).


export const meta = {
    title: "Coding with Video FX background",
    date: "2-18-2026",
    description: 'Why bother video edit?',
    status: "Published",
}

export default function MDXPage({ children }) {
  return <MdxLayout>{children}</MdxLayout>

}
