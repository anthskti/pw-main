# Run Down

"We all live life at our own pace," that was something I needed to hear.

A lot of people my age have full interships this summer, working at shopify, amazon, google, but I am here still trying to get my foot in the door.

So I took a summer class for building a project, possibly make up for the opportunities I've missed, but it doesn't compare, I'm still broke.

While working at Costco, I've learned to speak to many people, asking for their stories and their advice on life; this not only opened my eyes to not just the top 1% getting internships, but also put me at ease, the stress of expectation I felt while not getting an internship.

If you're so fixated on a singular dead flower, you'll miss the view of a beautiful garden.

Anyways, I wanted to share some photos I've taken this summer.

export const meta = {
    title: "Summer Collection 2025: Season of Beauty",
    date: "8-29-2025",
    description: "A collection of pictures and a review of my summer!",
    status: "Processing",
}

export default function MDXPage({ children }) {
  return <MdxLayout>{children}</MdxLayout>

}
