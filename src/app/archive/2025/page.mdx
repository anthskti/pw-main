# Yearly Update: Edition 2025

Hi, welcome back to another Anth's Archive.

In this post I'll go over my Stats!

### Fitness PR:

- Barbell Bench Press: 165lb for 3 reps.
- Squat: 185 for 2 reps.

##### Goal: Flexibility and Body Weight mastery.

Why? Living a long life without any health issue is one of my biggest goals in life. I've seen a lot of people who has to deal with bodily injuries due to lifestyle. Obviously circumstance may happen, but my goal is to prevent what I can.

### Hobbies:

- Improved Haircutting abilities.
- Had a 2025 Summer Piano arc, learning three songs: Fontaine Theme, Dooby's Train Theme, Gimai Seikatsu's Diary Reel Theme, and Jay Chou's A Dandelion's Promise.
- I've gotten into building 3D wooden structures. I'll add pictures eventually... (hopefully...)
- More conciously improving my speaking infront of a camera.
- I've been enjoying (MODERATELY) gaming with my friends.
- I read two books... yeah it's not a lot, but for someone who is not a book guy, I'm proud of it.
- COOKING, I've been inspired by my favourite chef, Loid Forger, to create more dishes, and I've only made like three dishes, but I've mastered them this past year. Hopefully I get pictures for it and can upload it here too!

##### Goal: Start Video Editing Again...

Tap back into my one of my favourite hobbies that started my drive to create.

I'll make an archive about this soon.

### Development / Coding:

- Learned a lot of full-stacks technologies and successfully built a fully functioning live website this year (shout out PowerRange and ClearUp).
- Went to three hackathon this year.
- Made this website lol.
- Slowly, but steadly working on my Neetcode Journey (Leetcode but specialized).
- Applying to a lot of jobs... Hopefully I get an internship or a position soon.

##### Goal: Land a SWE Position in 2026!

How will I do that? Trust myself, keep working at it. Diamonds are built under pressure, so just keep running, just keep improving, just keep asking questions; I'll make it, and I'll document it all.
