## _Yearly Regards: Edition 2025_

Hi, welcome back to another Anth’s Archive😄

In this post, I’ll go over my stats for 2025!

## Development / Coding:

* Learned a lot of full-stacks technologies and successfully built a fully functioning live website this year (shout out PowerRange and ClearUp).
* Went to three hackathon this year.
* Made this website lol.
* Slowly, but steadly working on my Neetcode Journey (Leetcode but specialized).
* Applying to a lot of jobs… Hopefully I get an internship or a position soon.

Goal: Land a SWE Position in 2026!

How will I do that? Trust myself, keep working at it. Diamonds are built under pressure, so just keep running, just keep improving, just keep asking questions; I’ll make it, and I’ll document it all.

## Fitness PR:

* Body Weight: 145lb or 65kg
* My Physique: Need Improvement😅 I’m still pretty small imo
* Barbell Bench Press: 165lb x 3 reps.
* Barbell Squat: 185lb x 2 reps.

Goal: flexibility and body weight mastery. Filling out my size too with hypertrophy.

Why? Living a long life without any health issues is one of my biggest goals in life. I’ve seen many people who have to deal with bodily injuries due to lifestyle. I understand things happen, but my goal is to prevent what I can.

## My Hobbies:

* Haircutting abilities ↑
* Had a 2025 Summer Piano Arc, learning four songs: Fontaine Theme, Dooby’s Train Theme, Gimai Seikatsu’s Diary Reel Theme, and Jay Chou’s A Dandelion’s Promise.
* I’ve gotten into building 3D wooden structures. See figure 1... jk, check out the bottom of the slides. I also streamed it if you want to watch here: [https://youtu.be/e0uQcnmAXOg?si=lmY1W2M8iNa5Q3pW](https://youtu.be/e0uQcnmAXOg?si=lmY1W2M8iNa5Q3pWz)
* Trying to be more confident in my speech in front of a camera.
* I’ve been enjoying (MODERATELY) gaming with my friends.
* I read two books… yeah it’s not a lot, but for someone who is not a book guy, I’m proud of it.
* COOKING, I’ve been inspired by my favourite chef, Loid Forger, to create more dishes, and I’ve only made like three dishes, but I’ve mastered them this past year. Hopefully I get pictures for it and can upload it here too! (Thanks to my aunt, who got me a cookbook).

Goal: Tap back into my one of my favourite hobbies that started my drive to create, video editing.
I have a playlist of all the videos I’ve edited before, check it out here: [Sakuti Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@sakuti).
I’ll make an archive about this soon. An entry is up, check it out [here](/archive/video-editing).

This is all the non-related statistics:

* I worked hard; working as a Costco employee part-time while attending school full-time. 
* I can cut my own hair now.



Thank you for reading this, take care, Anthony
